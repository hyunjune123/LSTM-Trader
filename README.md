# LSTM Price trend estimator

Research project by Woo June Cha under supervision of professor Chad Shafer from Carnegie Mellon University.

## Abstract
For non-financial experts, it is difficult to determine when to enter a position in a stock market. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model, specifically an LSTM binary classification model, that could estimate the price trend and identify price trend shifts. We can exploit the model output to make trade decisions that would yield profit.
